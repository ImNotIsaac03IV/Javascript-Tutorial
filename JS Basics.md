# JavaScript Basics Review

## Console Logging
- Use `console.log()` to print data to the console, a panel that displays messages.

## Comments
- Single-line comments: `//`
- Multi-line comments: `/* ... */`

## Data Types
JavaScript has 8 fundamental data types:
1. **Numbers**: Any number without quotes (e.g., `23.8879`).
2. **BigInts**: For very large integers.
3. **Strings**: Characters wrapped in single or double quotes (e.g., `'Sample String'`).
4. **Booleans**: `true` or `false`.
5. **null**: Represents an intentional absence of any object value.
6. **undefined**: Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.
7. **Symbol**: A unique and immutable primitive value.
8. **Object**: A collection of properties and methods.

## Arithmetic Operators
- Built-in operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

## Objects
- **Properties**: Stored information accessed with a `.` (e.g., `'Hello'.length`).
- **Methods**: Actions performed by appending the object with a `.`, method name, and parentheses (e.g., `'hello'.toUpperCase()`).

## Built-in Objects
- **Math**: A collection of methods and properties provided by JavaScript.
