# JavaScript Versions: ES6 and Before

## What is ES6?
- **ES6** stands for **ECMAScript 6**, the 6th edition of the ECMAScript standard.
- Also referred to as **ES2015** (released in 2015).
- It is the most significant update to JavaScript since its inception in 1997.

---

## A Brief History of JavaScript
- **1995**: JavaScript was introduced by Netscape Communications.
- **1996**: Netscape submitted JavaScript to **Ecma International** to create standards.
- **1997**: Ecma International released **ECMA-262**, the first version of the ECMAScript standard.
- ECMAScript provides the rules and guidelines for JavaScript's architecture.

## JavaScript vs. ECMAScript
- **JavaScript**: A scripting language used to create apps and programs.
- **ECMAScript**: A standard for scripting languages. JavaScript follows ECMAScript standards.

---

## Why is ES6 Still Relevant?
- ES6 introduced major features that revolutionized JavaScript development.
- Many modern frameworks (e.g., React) rely on ES6 features.
- ES6 is often referred to as **"Modern JavaScript"** due to its significant improvements.

## Key Features of ES6
1. **`let` and `const`**:
   - New ways to declare variables (`let` for reassignable variables, `const` for constants).
2. **Arrow Functions**:
   - Shorter syntax for writing functions.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     // Pre-ES6
     var greeting = function() {
       console.log('Hello World!');
     };

     // ES6
     const greeting = () => console.log('Hello World!');
     ```
3. **Classes**:
   - Introduced a cleaner syntax for object-oriented programming (OOP).
4. **Default Parameters**:
   - Allows setting default values for function parameters.
5. **Promises**:
   - Improved handling of asynchronous operations.
6. **Template Literals**:
   - Use backticks (`` ` ``) and `${}` for string interpolation.
7. **Many More**:
   - Destructuring, modules, enhanced object literals, etc.

## Why Learn ES6?
- **Concise Code**: ES6 allows developers to write cleaner and more efficient code.
- **Modern Frameworks**: Many popular frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) use ES6 features.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: ES6 makes it easier to use OOP principles in JavaScript.
- **Industry Adoption**: ES6 is widely adopted in the development community.

## Legacy Code and Pre-ES6
- Many existing projects still use **pre-ES6 JavaScript**.
- Familiarity with both pre-ES6 and ES6 syntax is essential for working on a wide range of projects.

## Example: Pre-ES6 vs. ES6
### Variable Declaration
- **Pre-ES6**:
  ```javascript
  var name = "Alice";
